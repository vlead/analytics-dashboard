* Description
** We need to provide analytics for the virtual-labs(https://github.com/virtual-labs) organization in terms of:
*** Total number of repositories
*** Total number of issues.
*** Total number of commits
*** Top active repositories in terms of:
**** Issues closed
**** Commits made in the last six months
**** number of different developers working on each repository.
*** List the languages used in this organization.
** Version of python to be used: 2.7
** Data is available in https://github.com/virtual-labs
** Project does not need Ansible
** Need to use literate style of programming.
** The analytics should be expressed in terms of  bar graphs , pie charts etc ,whichever form user can easily understand from pictures. The details of above mentioned analytics are to be shown like a beautiful story with “Visualization Zoo” as a reference. We also need to use d3.js for this project.
* Profile of users
** The different users of the project can be:
*** Virtual lab developers
*** Users of different repositories in virtual-labs
*** Owners of the repositories in virtual-labs
*** Virtual lab owners to know the different  analytics of virtual-labs
* Usage Model and Diagrams (if any)
** Virtual lab owners will get an idea of how many repositories are being created every year and the appropriate graph used for representing it will make it very clear for them. 

** Developers in virtual-labs can make use of the information about different languages used to write the respective code(software).

** Repository owners can get back their previous version of code pushed and also information about the different issues and commits can also be retrieved.
